<p class="message">About</p>
This is the blog which is run by the people creating the service [www.finn.no](https://www.finn.no/).
Our purpose with this blog is to provide an insight into how we build things and to share our experiences with anyone who is interested in learning.

Why do we typically write in english here when norwegian is our mother tongue?
At finn.no we want programming standards to be first class. To be first class means to be world class and that means being engaged in the international programming community, which today has generally adopted the english language.
