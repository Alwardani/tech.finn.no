Browser statistics May 2015
===========================

In [July 2013 more than 40% of the visits to FINN.no](http://hjemmehos.finn.no/no/webfolk_+_entusiaster/finn_labs/FINN-statistikken+for+sommeren+2013.9UFRnSXl.ips) were from a tablet or a phone. Nearly one year later, in [April 2014 - 48% were from a table or a phone](http://www.inma.no/ARTIKLER/Blogg/innlegg/FINN-statistikken-for-april-2014). What has changed the last year?

Google rolled out the [mobile-friendly update](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.no/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html) April the 21st, which boosts the ranking of sites that are mobile friendly in the Google search. We're clearly not the only one seeing the increased market share of mobile devices.
