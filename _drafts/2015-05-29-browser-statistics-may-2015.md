In [July 2013 more than 40% of the visits to FINN.no](http://hjemmehos.finn.no/no/webfolk_+_entusiaster/finn_labs/FINN-statistikken+for+sommeren+2013.9UFRnSXl.ips) were from a tablet or a phone. Nearly one year later, in [April 2014 - the share was 48%](http://www.inma.no/ARTIKLER/Blogg/innlegg/FINN-statistikken-for-april-2014).

*What do you think has happened the last year?*

In April, Google rolled out thir ["mobile-friendly update"](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.no/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html), which boosts the ranking of sites that are mobile friendly in the Google search. We're clearly not the only one seeing the increased market share of mobile devices.

## How many visitors use a desktop or laptop?

Our first graph shows the share of our users using a mobile phone, tablet or a desktop computer to access FINN.no, regardless of whether they use the traditional somewhat-responsive-desktop-version (www.finn.no), our responsive mobile web (m.finn.no) or an Android or iPhone app. 62% of our visits are now from a smartphone or a tablet. *The traditional desktop/laptop has a market share of 38%.*

## Which FINN.no channel do they use?

The reponsive site is now the biggest! 14% of our visits are from our native apps, 42% from www.finn.no, and 44% from our responsive m.finn.no.

Do you remember the "browser wars"? When IE 6.0 ruled the web? And we thought it was a nearly impossible job to test for all three major browsers? Welcome to 2015. First of all, let's take a look at the numbers of the browser vendors. The ranking is clear, Apple is biggest, ahead of Google, Microsoft and Mozilla - and Opera is still in the top 5.

If we exclude the mobile browsers, we get the quite irrelevant graph showing who is leading the desktop browser race.

I'd argue that taking a look at the current browsers actually accessing our services is much more relevant if you are considering whether you should make your site work well on Mobile Safari.

In case you still have Internet Explorer 9 as your favourite, here's the graph showing top 15 browsers, covering nearly 90% of all our visits.
