We have reworked our [graded browser support matrix](http://labs.finn.no/nettlesermatrisen/) which was [released last year](/2011/01/07/graded-browser-support-at-finn-no/). Following [the Laws of Simplicity](http://lawsofsimplicity.com/) we reduced the complexity in order to make it easier for everyone at our company to understand. We cut a lot of the version number into targeting latest for browsers which are frequently updated. There is also a [support matrix for mobile phones](http://labs.finn.no/nettlesermatrisen/phone.html) which is targeting our new mobile web service [m.finn.no](http://m.finn.no).

In addition to updating the versions we have also made the decision to include tablets in the support matrix for our desktop verison of our service. This is because we are currently not looking at creating specialized versions for tablets and our service works just fine on the tablets currently hitting our site. Currently almost all of our trafic is coming from iPad's, therefor Andoid powered devices are not supported.
