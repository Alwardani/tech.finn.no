In [July 2013 more than 40% of the visits to FINN.no](http://hjemmehos.finn.no/no/webfolk_+_entusiaster/finn_labs/FINN-statistikken+for+sommeren+2013.9UFRnSXl.ips) were from a tablet or a phone. Nearly one year later, in April 2014 - [the share was 48%](http://www.inma.no/ARTIKLER/Blogg/innlegg/FINN-statistikken-for-april-2014).

*What do you think has happened the last year?*

In April, Google rolled out their ["mobile-friendly update"](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.no/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html), which boosts the ranking of sites that are mobile friendly in the Google search. We're clearly not the only one seeing the increased market share of mobile devices.

## How many visitors use a desktop or laptop?

Our first graph shows the share of our users using a mobile phone, tablet or a desktop computer to access FINN.no, regardless of whether they use the traditional somewhat-responsive-desktop-web (www.finn.no), our responsive mobile web (m.finn.no) or an Android or iPhone app. 62% of our visits are now from a smartphone or a tablet. *The traditional desktop/laptop has a market share of 38%.*

## Which FINN.no application do people use?

We have three major versions of FINN.no - the desktop, the responsive m.finn.no, and native apps. Our reponsive site is now the biggest! 14% of our visits are from our native apps, 42% from www.finn.no, and 44% from our responsive m.finn.no.

## Browsers

First of all, let's take a look at the numbers of the *browser vendors*. The ranking is clear, Apple is the biggest, ahead of Google, Microsoft and Mozilla - and Opera is still in the top 5, representing more than an amazing 0.2% of our visits.

Do you remember the "browser wars"? When IE 8.0 ruled the web? In case you wondered which browser is the biggest on the "desktop" here's the trend:

The *complete browser statistics*, across all applications are as follows:

It seems like a good idea to make sure your website works well with Safari!

In case you still have Internet Explorer 9 as your favourite, it's still making it to the top 15, with a total share of 1.2% of our traffic, marginally behind Internet Explorer 10 with 1.4%. In 2015, poor IE8 is down to 0.3%.
